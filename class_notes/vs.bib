@inproceedings{nngraph,
	abstract = {K-Nearest Neighbor Graph (K-NNG) construction is an important operation with many web related applications, including collaborative filtering, similarity search, and many others in data mining and machine learning. Existing methods for K-NNG construction either do not scale, or are specific to certain similarity measures. We present NN-Descent, a simple yet efficient algorithm for approximate K-NNG construction with arbitrary similarity measures. Our method is based on local search, has minimal space overhead and does not rely on any shared global index. Hence, it is especially suitable for large-scale applications where data structures need to be distributed over the network. We have shown with a variety of datasets and similarity measures that the proposed method typically converges to above 90\% recall with each point comparing only to several percent of the whole dataset on average.},

@inproceedings{neuralQuantization,
	abstract = {We tackle the problem of unsupervised visual descriptors compression, which is a key ingredient of large-scale image retrieval systems. While the deep learning machinery has benefited literally all computer vision pipelines, the existing state-of-the-art compression methods employ shallow architectures, and we aim to close this gap by our paper. In more detail, we introduce a DNN architecture for the unsupervised compressed-domain retrieval, based on multi-codebook quantization. The proposed architecture is designed to incorporate both fast data encoding and efficient distances computation via lookup tables. We demonstrate the exceptional advantage of our scheme over existing quantization approaches on several datasets of visual descriptors via outperforming the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin.},

@inproceedings{LSQ,
	abstract = {Multi-codebook quantization (MCQ) is the task of expressing a set of vectors as accurately as possible in terms of discrete entries in multiple bases. Work in MCQ is heavily focused on lowering quantization error, thereby improving distance estimation and recall on benchmarks of visual descriptors at a fixed memory budget. However, recent studies and methods in this area are hard to compare against each other, because they use different datasets, different protocols, and, perhaps most importantly, different computational budgets. In this work, we first benchmark a series of MCQ baselines on an equal footing and provide an analysis of their recall-vs-running-time performance. We observe that local search quantization (LSQ) is in practice much faster than its competitors, but is not the most accurate method in all cases. We then introduce two novel improvements that render LSQ (i) more accurate and (ii) faster. These improvements are easy to implement, and define a new state of the art in MCQ.},

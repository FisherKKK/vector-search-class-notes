## Vector Search
The course Vector Search is given in Princeton Fall semester 2023 by

* [Edo Liberty](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QHS_pZAAAAAJ&hl=en), the Founder and CEO of [Pinecone](www.pinecone.io), the world's leading Vector Database.

* [Matthijs Douze](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0eFZtREAAAAJ&hl=en]) the creator and lead maintainer of [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) the most popular and advanced open source library for vector search.


The course covers the core concepts, algorithms, and data structures used for modern vector search systems and platforms. An advanced undergraduate or graduate student with some hands-on experience in linear algebra, probability, algorithms, and data structures should be able to follow this course.
